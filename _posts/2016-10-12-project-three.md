Evaluation of the 2015 Iowa Liquor Sales Dataset


<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Given 2015 and 2016 Iowa liquor sales data, determine the best locations for a new storefront.</p>

<h2>Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<p>We chose to work with only 10% of the dataset. There were 2.7 million transactions in the entire data and we only worked with 270,000 transactions. There were also several errors in the dataset. We cleaned up the data as extensively as we could but ended up dropping a couple hundred rows that didn't have complete data. We also did not remove any outliers so there could be one stores that heavily skews the data for certain counties.  </p>
<p>
We assumed that the best place to build a new store would be near stores that are performing exceptionally well. Our main assumption here is that location is the main predictor of success for our store, but a store can perform well for several different reasons. They can have very high advertising budgets, could have monopolies on certain areas (maybe a University only allows 2 liquor stores near campus), great supply chain management, etc. 
</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
We wanted to see which stores had the highest sales and where they were located. Des Moines had the two highest performing stores (2633 and 4829) which had total sales of $407,000 and $363,000 respectively. There is over a 50% dropoff to the next best store which was in Iowa City and had sales of $177,000 dollars.
